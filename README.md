# Introduction

Welcome to **Xylographic Xylary Xylem**, a human-centered knowledge atlas built on a Node.js and Express backend. The experience combines secure file uploads with persistent SQLite storage, making every contribution instantly available across the interface.

The single-page application presents every artifact on a canvas-driven, force-directed graph. Selecting a node opens its rich content inline, reinforcing the law-of-UX-inspired focus on minimizing cognitive load while keeping context at hand. This uninterrupted flow honors the project's human-centered design goals.

A dark, terminal-ricing-inspired Tailwind CSS theme surrounds the graph with deep charcoal gradients that still meet WCAG AA contrast targets. Accent colors pulse across interactive states, focus rings, and data highlights, ensuring accessibility and aesthetic cohesion in equal measure.
