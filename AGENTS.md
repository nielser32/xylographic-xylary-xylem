Essentials:
- Language: JavaScript  
- Runtime: Node.js  
- Framework: Express  
- Front end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS  
- Package manager: npm  

Extras:
- File uploads  
- Database (start with SQLite, option to expand later)  
- Canvas (for graphics and interactivity)  
- Visual interface showing all items on one page in a force-directed graph style  
- Each item clickable, opening its own page/content
- Tailwind theme customization with custom colors:
  primary: #ff339e
  secondary: #f8f7f7
  tertiary: #f53d9d
  quaternary: #ebccff
  quinary: #ec99ff
  The application must ship solely with a dark theme. Favor rich charcoal and obsidian
  background tones (e.g., #0c0c0f to #16161d) that create depth without sacrificing
  readability. Use the primary through quinary colors as vibrant accent highlights for
  interactive states, focus rings, key icons, and data visualization while ensuring all
  text and essential UI elements meet or exceed WCAG AA contrast requirements.
  Draw inspiration from terminal "ricing" aestheticsâ€”glow effects, subtle noise, and
  minimal neon pops are welcome. Feel free to introduce additional complementary accent
  hues when needed, provided they maintain accessible contrast against the dark base and
  harmonize with the established palette.
